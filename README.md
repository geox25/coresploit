Personal Exploitation Library, or PXL for short, is a software-suite that contains different tools and programs for both exploitation
and specialized tasks that would become too messy if they were packaged separately. The goal for PXL is to have a secure, high performance,
and highly customizable environment with numerous integrated systems. PXL is intended to be ran on Windows, Mac, and Linux. However, it
has only been tested on Windows and Linux right now.
